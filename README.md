# Java-Delaunay-Triangulation
A simple gui based java application that computes the Delaunay Triangulation on a 2 dimensional pointset in O(nlgn). n mathematics and computational geometry, a Delaunay triangulation for a set P of points in a plane is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P).
